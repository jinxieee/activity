    The Dinagyang Festival is a religious and cultural festival held annually on the fourth Sunday of January in Iloilo City, Philippines, in honor of Santo Ni√±o, the Holy Child, and to commemorate the historic pact between the Malay settlers and the indigenous Ati people of Panay. It is considered one of the largest and grandest festivals in the Philippines, attracting hundreds of thousands to over a million people during its celebration.[1][2]

The festival is renowned for its Ati Tribes Competition, where various tribu or tribal performers, dressed in "Ati warrior" costumes with large feathered headdresses, showcase traditional choreographed formations, patterns, and rhythmic chanting. The performances are accompanied by the beat of loud drums and improvised percussion instruments, narrating different iterations of the history of Panay. Another major highlight is the Kasadyahan Festival, where different cultural festivals from various places in Western Visayas come together to compete.

As the most awarded festival in the country, it has been named the best tourism event by the Association of Tourism Officers in the Philippines (ATOP) for several years. It is also sometimes referred to as the 'Queen of All Philippine Festivals.
